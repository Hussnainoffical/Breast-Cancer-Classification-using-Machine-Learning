🩺 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Description

This project leverages multiple machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on patient diagnostic features. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, the project compares models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify the most effective classifier.

A Streamlit web app is also developed to allow users to input tumor-related features and instantly get predictions on whether the tumor is likely benign or malignant.

This project highlights the importance of machine learning in healthcare, showcasing how data-driven approaches can assist in early diagnosis and decision support systems.
